# German Everyday

This repo is learning purpose only. 
Everyday I will add a new sentence in German (and it's translation in English), while I am learning new words in German.
You can learn and practice new words that I've already learned via the [flashcard app](https://hasantayyar.github.io/german_everyday/flashcard/index.html) 

You can also follow via [rss](#) or simple check this repo. (But I am to lazy to add the static rss genertator.)
